# I don't know Rust.

## Advent of Code, 2023

I've decided to do this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Rust. At the time of starting it, I'd only read half of [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and have yet to do a project in it. I'm going to continue reading this book and subsequent material in between doing these exercises, with the expectation that my practices and code quality will improve throughout the month. I also started this contest 2 weeks late, so I'm doing this at my leisure and not competing.

I guess this is a disclaimer for if you find this in my GitHub graveyard in 3 years.

Each day has two related exercises. As the second part often has significant changes, I've started each one in a separate folder rather than changing in place. The convention of aoc23d[day]p[part] should be obvious.

These will run with the input in the project folder named input.txt, example: `aoc23d3p1/input.txt`. If it doesn't run, it did with mine, so your input had an edge case, cool!

All of this was posted after respective leaderboards were full.

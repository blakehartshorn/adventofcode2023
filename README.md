# Advent of Code 2023

## I don't know Rust.

I see mainly 2 approaches to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), either you use a language you excel at to try to crush the exercises as fast as possible, or you use it as an opportunity to learn a new one. I'm doing the latter with Rust. At the time of writing this, I've completed the first 10 days and my code is still pretty terrible. I'm actively reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and various related documentation.

Each day has two related exercises. As the second part often has significant changes, I've started each one in a separate folder rather than changing in place. The convention of aoc23d[day]p[part] should be obvious.

The maintainer of AoC politely requests we don't upload our inputs (although everyone seems to do this). So if you want try out this code, you'll want to get your own from the site and save it into the relevant folder as input.txt, e.g. `aoc23d1p1/input.txt`. After this, run `cargo run` in that folder to execute.

All of this was posted after respective leaderboards were full.
